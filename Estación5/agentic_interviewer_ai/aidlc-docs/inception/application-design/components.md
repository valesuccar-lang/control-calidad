## Service 1: telegram-bot (Node.js / Telegraf)

### Component: TelegramGateway

**Responsibility**: Entry point for all Telegram messages. Receives webhooks from Telegram, extracts message content and chat ID, and routes to the ai-backend conversation-lambda.

**Key Behaviors**:
- Parse incoming Telegram Update objects (text messages, /start commands)
- Extract `chat_id`, `user_id`, `message_text`, `message_id` from each update
- Call conversation-lambda via HTTP POST with structured payload
- Return conversation-lambda response text back to Telegram via `sendMessage`
- Handle Telegram webhook verification (secret token validation)
- Log incoming messages and outgoing calls for observability

**Interfaces**:
- **Inbound**: Telegram Webhook POST (`/webhook`)
- **Outbound**: REST POST to `conversation-lambda` `/api/v1/messages`

---

### Component: SessionRouter

**Responsibility**: Determine if an incoming message belongs to an existing session or requires a new session to be started. Passes session context to TelegramGateway.

**Key Behaviors**:
- Construct the request payload for conversation-lambda from Telegram message data
- Attach `telegram_user_id` (hashed), `campaign_start_code` (from /start deep-link parameter), and message text
- Handle `/start` command: extract campaign ID from start parameter and include in payload
- Handle regular text messages: pass through to conversation-lambda with no campaign ID (session already exists in MongoDB)

---

### Component: MessageFormatter

**Responsibility**: Format responses from conversation-lambda into Telegram-compatible message objects with proper text, parse mode, and optional inline keyboards.

**Key Behaviors**:
- Convert plain text responses to Telegram `sendMessage` payloads
- Apply HTML or Markdown parse mode as configured
- Split long messages that exceed Telegram's 4096-character limit
- Format the NPS survey as Telegram inline keyboard (1-5 buttons)

---

## Service 2: conversation-lambda (Python / FastAPI + Claude Agent SDK)

### Component: ConversationRouter (FastAPI App)

**Responsibility**: FastAPI application entry point for the conversation-lambda. Routes incoming API calls to the appropriate handler.

**Key Behaviors**:
- Expose POST `/api/v1/messages` endpoint (called by telegram-bot)
- Validate JWT or shared secret on all incoming requests from telegram-bot
- Route to ConversationOrchestrator for message processing
- Return structured response: `{ "text": "...", "session_state": "..." }`

---

### Component: ConversationOrchestrator

**Responsibility**: Core agentic conversation controller. Manages the multi-turn screening flow by reading session state from MongoDB, determining the current stage, invoking Claude, and persisting updated state.

**Key Behaviors**:
- Load current session from MongoDB by `telegram_user_id` + `campaign_id`
- Determine current conversation stage: `AWAITING_CONSENT`, `REQUIREMENTS_CHECK`, `SCREENING`, `ESCALATED`, `COMPLETED`, `ABANDONED`
- Dispatch to the appropriate stage handler (ConsentHandler, RequirementsHandler, ScreeningHandler)
- Persist all conversation events (messages, stage transitions) to MongoDB
- Return the agent's next response text

---

### Component: ConsentHandler

**Responsibility**: Manages the onboarding and consent stage of the conversation. Ensures AI identity is disclosed and explicit consent is recorded before any evaluation begins.

**Key Behaviors**:
- Generate onboarding message with AI disclosure, purpose, data usage, and consent request
- Parse candidate response to detect affirmative consent ("sí", "acepto", "ok", etc.) or refusal
- On consent: write immutable consent event to AuditLogger; transition session to `REQUIREMENTS_CHECK`
- On refusal: send graceful exit message; mark session as `CONSENT_DECLINED`; do not create evaluation record

---

### Component: RequirementsHandler

**Responsibility**: Manages the basic requirements verification stage. Asks configurable pre-screening questions and decides if the candidate qualifies to proceed.

**Key Behaviors**:
- Load campaign's required criteria list from MongoDB
- Ask one requirement question at a time in conversational style
- Parse candidate responses against expected criteria (availability, location, documentation)
- On all criteria met: transition session to `SCREENING`
- On criteria not met: send polite disqualification message; mark session `DISQUALIFIED_REQUIREMENTS`

---

### Component: ScreeningHandler

**Responsibility**: Core competency screening handler. Generates contextual competency questions and follow-ups using Claude, enforces guardrails, and collects evidence for evaluation.

**Key Behaviors**:
- Load campaign rubric (competencies, question templates) from MongoDB
- Generate the next competency question using Claude, informed by rubric and conversation history
- Detect response completeness: if vague, generate one follow-up; if sufficient, move to next competency
- Route out-of-scope questions to GuardrailsFilter
- After all competencies covered: transition session to `AWAITING_EVALUATION` and call evaluation-lambda
- Track question index and answered competencies in session state

---

### Component: GuardrailsFilter

**Responsibility**: Intercepts candidate messages before they reach the Claude reasoning layer. Detects out-of-scope questions, jailbreak attempts, and inappropriate content.

**Key Behaviors**:
- Check message against out-of-scope patterns (salary, benefits, policy questions)
- Detect jailbreak attempts ("ignore your instructions", "reveal your rubric")
- Detect explicit requests for human escalation ("quiero hablar con una persona")
- On out-of-scope: return scripted response + log escalation event via ComplianceClient
- On jailbreak attempt: return security response + log attempt
- On human escalation request: return acknowledgment + trigger EscalationNotifier
- Pass-through: forward clean messages to ScreeningHandler / ConversationOrchestrator

---

### Component: ReengagementScheduler

**Responsibility**: Manages the automated re-engagement flow for inactive sessions. Detects sessions that have gone silent and schedules follow-up messages.

**Key Behaviors**:
- Triggered by scheduled Lambda event (every 30 minutes) — not per-message
- Query MongoDB for sessions in `PAUSED` or `IN_PROGRESS` state with last activity > 24h
- Send 24h follow-up message via Telegram API directly
