### Architecture Pattern: Polyglot Intentional

```
Telegram  <-->  [Service 1: telegram-bot]          [Service 2: ai-backend]
                Node.js + Telegraf (TypeScript)  --> Python + FastAPI + Claude Agent SDK
                Handles Telegram webhooks            Handles AI logic, MongoDB, Pinecone
                Routes messages to ai-backend        Returns structured responses
```

- **Service 1** (`telegram-bot`): Node.js + Telegraf — thin gateway, handles Telegram protocol, delegates AI logic to Service 2 via REST API
- **Service 2** (`ai-backend`): Python + FastAPI + Claude Agent SDK — conversational engine, evaluation, compliance, data persistence
- **Service 3** (`dashboard`): React + TypeScript + Vite — recruiter web app, calls ai-backend REST API

| FR-01.5 | Bot maintains stateless operation — all session state is managed by ai-backend |
| FR-01.6 | Bot handles connection errors gracefully and retries on transient failures |

### FR-02: Conversational Engine (Service 2 — Python/FastAPI)

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| FR-02.1 | System conducts multi-turn conversational screening using Claude as reasoning engine |
| FR-02.2 | Agent presents onboarding message identifying itself as AI before any evaluation |

| FR-02.6 | Agent adapts follow-up questions based on previous candidate responses in the same session |
| FR-02.7 | System persists full conversation session state in MongoDB (active, paused, abandoned, completed) |
| FR-02.8 | System supports session resumption — candidate can return to an abandoned session with context preserved |
| FR-02.9 | System handles re-engagement: automated follow-up at 24h inactivity, final reminder at 48h, mark abandoned at 72h |
| FR-02.10 | System tracks abandonment point (which question) per session for analytics |

### FR-03: Guardrails and Anti-Hallucination

| ID | Requirement |

| FR-07.8 | Data is strictly isolated per tenant (tenant_id enforced on all queries) |

### FR-08: Human Escalation

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| FR-08.1 | System supports 3-level escalation: (1) out-of-scope question → log and continue, (2) repeated out-of-scope → flag to recruiter, (3) explicit human request → halt and alert |
| FR-08.2 | When candidate requests a human, agent saves progress and triggers dashboard notification to recruiter |
| FR-08.3 | Recruiter dashboard shows escalation queue with conversation context and pending questions |
| FR-08.4 | After human intervention, session can be closed or marked for follow-up |

## Key Constraints

1. **HITL is non-negotiable** — AI never auto-approves or auto-rejects candidates
2. **Transparency is non-negotiable** — AI identity disclosed before evaluation begins, consent required
3. **Traceability is non-negotiable** — Every score linked to textual citation; logs immutable
4. **No biometric data** — Text-only evaluation; no facial, voice, or emotional analysis
5. **Multi-tenancy isolation** — Tenant data never crosses boundaries
6. **Security rules enforced** — All SECURITY-01 to SECURITY-15 are blocking
