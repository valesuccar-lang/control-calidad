## Detailed Analysis Summary

### Change Impact Assessment

| Impact Area | Status | Description |
|---|---|---|
| User-facing changes | YES | Telegram bot (candidate) + web dashboard (recruiter/operator) — both new |
| Structural changes | YES | 3 new services: `telegram-bot` (Node.js), `ai-backend` (Python), `dashboard` (React) |
| Data model changes | YES | New: Candidate, Session, Message, Evaluation, Campaign, Rubric, ConsentLog, KnowledgeDoc |
| API changes | YES | New REST API between telegram-bot and ai-backend; new dashboard API |
| NFR impact | YES | Security Baseline (SECURITY-01 to SECURITY-15), performance (100+ concurrent), serverless scaling |

### Architecture Pattern
```
[Telegram API] <--> [Service 1: telegram-bot (Node.js/Telegraf, AWS Lambda)]
                              |
                              | REST API (HTTP)
                              v
                    [Service 2: ai-backend (Python/FastAPI + Claude Agent SDK, AWS Lambda)]
                              |
                    +---------+---------+
                    |                   |
              [MongoDB Atlas]      [Pinecone]
              (primary store)      (vector/RAG)

[Recruiter Browser] --> [Service 3: dashboard (React/Vite, CloudFront + S3)]
                              |
                              | REST API (HTTP + JWT)
                              v
                    [Service 2: ai-backend]
```

### Risk Assessment

| Dimension | Level | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Overall Risk** | High | New system, AI reasoning complexity, LATAM compliance, multi-service polyglot architecture |
| **Rollback Complexity** | Moderate | Serverless Lambda rollback is straightforward; DB schema is document-based (flexible) |
| **Testing Complexity** | Complex | AI outputs require human evaluation; 10 red-team scenarios; multi-service integration |
| **Regulatory Risk** | Medium | EU AI Act classification as High-Risk system; Colombia AI ethics regulation in progress |

## Phases to Execute

### INCEPTION PHASE

| Stage | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Workspace Detection | COMPLETED | Greenfield confirmed, no prior code |
| Reverse Engineering | SKIPPED | Greenfield — nothing to reverse-engineer |
| Requirements Analysis | COMPLETED | 10 FR areas, 7 NFR areas, full tech stack |
| User Stories | COMPLETED | 34 stories, 4 personas, 7 epics |
| Workflow Planning | IN PROGRESS | This document |
| **Application Design** | **EXECUTE** | 3 new services with inter-service REST APIs; complex AI agent module boundaries need design before coding; polyglot architecture increases risk of interface mismatch |
| **Units Generation** | **EXECUTE** | 3 distinct services (telegram-bot, ai-backend, dashboard) each warrant their own construction unit; ai-backend itself has multiple distinct modules (conversational engine, evaluation, compliance, RAG); decomposition ensures focused development cycles |

### CONSTRUCTION PHASE — Per Unit

| Stage | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Functional Design** | **EXECUTE** | New data models (Session, Evaluation, Campaign, Rubric); complex business logic (multi-turn state machine, evaluation scoring, guardrails); HITL decision flow requires detailed design |
| **NFR Requirements** | **EXECUTE** | Security Baseline ENABLED (SECURITY-01 to SECURITY-15); explicit performance NFRs (< 5s latency, 100+ concurrent); serverless cold-start mitigation required |
| **NFR Design** | **EXECUTE** | Follows from NFR Requirements; rate limiting design, JWT security design, MongoDB encryption, Pinecone namespace isolation, structured logging architecture |
| **Infrastructure Design** | **EXECUTE** | Multi-service AWS infrastructure: API Gateway, Lambda functions per service, MongoDB Atlas VPC peering, Pinecone integration, CloudFront + S3 for dashboard, Secrets Manager, CloudWatch |
| **Code Generation** | **EXECUTE** | Always — core deliverable |
| **Build and Test** | **EXECUTE** | Always — comprehensive test suite including red-team scenarios from PRD |

### OPERATIONS PHASE

| Stage | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Operations | PLACEHOLDER | Future deployment and monitoring workflows |

## Anticipated Units of Work

*Note: Formal unit decomposition occurs in Units Generation stage. This is a preview to inform planning.*

| Unit | Service | Description | Primary Stories |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit 1 | `telegram-bot` | Node.js/Telegraf gateway service — handles Telegram protocol, session routing to ai-backend | US-01 to US-05, US-26 to US-27 |
| Unit 2 | `ai-backend/conversation` | Python conversational engine — Claude Agent SDK, multi-turn state machine, guardrails, re-engagement | US-06 to US-10, US-29 |
| Unit 3 | `ai-backend/evaluation` | Python evaluation engine — rubric scoring, executive summary generation, citation extraction | US-11 to US-14, US-31 |
| Unit 4 | `ai-backend/campaign-api` | Python campaign, knowledge base, and RAG management — REST API for dashboard | US-19 to US-22, US-33 |
| Unit 5 | `ai-backend/compliance-api` | Python compliance, consent, audit logs, candidate lifecycle, NPS, auth API | US-03, US-23 to US-25, US-28 |
| Unit 6 | `dashboard` | React/TypeScript SPA — review queue, campaign management, analytics, candidate detail | US-15 to US-18, US-20, US-24 |

## Success Criteria

| Criterion | Target |
|---|---|
| Primary Goal | Fully functional EntreVista AI MVP: Telegram bot + AI backend + recruiter dashboard |
